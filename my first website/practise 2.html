    <div>
        <p>Welcome to my travel blog, Love Travelling.  I'm Saiful,and i am writing about my visits to countries near and far.I research destinations myself and that’s part of the fun – visiting the local library and selecting some travel guides, looking things up online and, of course, all the amazing tips I discover from fellow travel bloggers.I love the planning, the anticipation, the journey, be it by plane, train, bus or boat and of course, the actual holiday and finally all the wonderful memories and experiences I bring home that live with me forever.  That was the original reason why I created this blog so that I could have an online diary of my recent trips to look back on in the future.  I’ve been surprised but thrilled that so many of you have taken an interest in my travels and enjoy reading about my trips – it’s very encouraging and makes me very happy!  From starting as a hobby my blog has evolved into an award winning online travel resource providing inspiration to fellow travellers.</p>
